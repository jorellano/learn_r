Basic data types in R

R works with numerous data types. Some of the most basic types to get started are:

Decimal values like 4.5 are called numerics.
Natural numbers like 4 are called integers. Integers are also numerics.
Boolean values (TRUE or FALSE) are called logical.
Text (or string) values are called characters.
